# Development Environment Setup

## Technologies and Tools Used

- IDE (Visual Studio Code): We recommend using a TypeScript-compatible IDE for efficient development.

- Node 18v or + installed

- Docker: Used to create and manage containers, making it easier to configure the development environment.

<br />

## Architecture and designer patterns

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Use the DDD pattern to structure and organize the code, ensuring a solid and modular architecture.

- Clean Architecture: Organize the application following the principles of Clean Architecture, separating the layers clearly: Business Entities, Use Cases, Controllers, etc.
- SOLID: Apply the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle) to promote robust and flexible code design.
- CQS (Command Query Separation): Separate read operations (queries) from write operations (commands) to improve code clarity and maintainability.

## TypeScript application development (Core) by modules

## Integration with RabbitMQ, Keycloak, Logs and Video Encoder

### Technologies used:

- RabbitMQ: Implement integration with RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.

- Keycloak: Integrate Keycloak for identity management and authentication.
- Logs: Implement logs for monitoring and tracking important events.
- Video Encoder: Integrate a video encoder for video processing and optimization.

## CI (Continuous Integration)

### Technologies used:

- GitHub Actions: Setting up workflows for continuous integration.

- Dockerfile for Production: Create a Dockerfile optimized for production.
